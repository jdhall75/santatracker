# santatracker

This year for the kids around the house I wanted to do something fun and educational.  I made a RaspberryPi powered santa sighting alerter.  The SantaTracker.py script follows @noradsanta on twitter and flashes an LED everytime that @noradsanta tweets about a sighting. I also integrated a little morse code into the project to flash christmas messages that the kids had to decode.  You can make a game out of it and give out secret santa gifts for the one who decodes the most messages.
 
 You will need to go to twitter and start up a developer account. [Twitter Developers](https://dev.twitter.com/)
 
 I used tweepy to hand the authentication and filtering of twitter. [Tweepy read the docs](http://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/v3.5.0/index.html)
